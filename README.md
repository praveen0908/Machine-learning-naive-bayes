# Income Classification Dataset

## Dataset Description

This dataset contains various details of individuals along with their income levels classified as either greater than 50K or less than or equal to 50K. Below are the attributes present in the dataset:

- **Age:** Continuous numerical variable representing the age of individuals.
- **Workclass:** Categorical variable describing the type of employment, including options like Private, Self-employed, Government positions, and more.
- **Fnlwgt:** Continuous numerical variable.
- **Education:** Categorical variable indicating the highest level of education attained, ranging from Preschool to Doctorate.
- **Education-num:** Continuous numerical variable representing the numerical equivalent of education levels.
- **Marital-status:** Categorical variable describing the marital status of individuals.
- **Occupation:** Categorical variable indicating the occupation of the individuals.
- **Relationship:** Categorical variable indicating the individual's role in relationships.
- **Race:** Categorical variable describing the race of individuals.
- **Sex:** Categorical variable indicating the gender of individuals.
- **Capital-gain:** Continuous numerical variable.
- **Capital-loss:** Continuous numerical variable.
- **Hours-per-week:** Continuous numerical variable representing the number of hours worked per week.
- **Native-country:** Categorical variable indicating the native country of individuals.
- **Income:** Target variable categorizing individuals into ">50K" or "<=50K" income groups.

## Naive Bayes Classifier

### Algorithm Description

The Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm commonly used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class label, which simplifies the calculation of class probabilities.

### Implementation

The Naive Bayes classifier will be used to predict the income level (">50K" or "<=50K") based on the provided dataset attributes. The steps for implementation are as follows:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Data will be preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale/normalize numerical features if necessary.

2. **Training:** The classifier will be trained on a portion of the dataset, typically using a training-validation split.

3. **Model Evaluation:** The classifier's performance will be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Prediction:** Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict the income levels of new, unseen data.

### Dependencies

To run the Naive Bayes classifier, you may need the following Python libraries:

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

### Usage

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
2. Use the provided dataset to train and test the Naive Bayes classifier.
3. Evaluate the classifier's performance and make predictions on new data.

### Future Work

Consider exploring the following areas for further improvement:

- Feature selection and engineering to enhance model performance.
- Trying different machine learning algorithms for comparison.
- Tuning hyperparameters for better model accuracy.
